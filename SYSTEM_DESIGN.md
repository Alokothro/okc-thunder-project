# NBA Practice Performance Analysis System Design

## System Overview

This system is designed to capture, analyze, and visualize player performance data during NBA practice sessions using multi-camera video feeds and advanced analytics. The architecture leverages cloud-native technologies, computer vision, and real-time data processing to provide coaches with actionable insights.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Capture Layer

**Video Capture Infrastructure:**

- Camera types: 4K resolution overhead cameras for full-court coverage, sideline cameras for player-specific tracking
- Network-attached storage (NAS) for raw video buffering
- Edge computing devices for initial video processing

**Technologies:**
- **AWS Kinesis Video Streams** for real-time video ingestion
- **NVIDIA Jetson** edge devices for local GPU processing
- **GStreamer** for video pipeline management

### 2. Computer Vision & Processing Layer

**Player Tracking & Event Detection:**
- Real-time player identification and tracking using pose estimation
- Ball tracking for shot attempts, passes, and turnovers
- Action classification (pick & roll, isolation, post-up, off-ball screens)

**Technologies:**
- **OpenPose/MediaPipe** for pose estimation and player skeletal tracking
- **YOLO v8** for object detection (players, ball, hoop)
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for custom action classification models
- **Apache Kafka** for event streaming between services
- **AWS SageMaker** for model training and deployment

### 3. Data Storage & Management

**Multi-tier Storage Architecture:**
- Hot storage for recent practice data (last 7 days)
- Warm storage for current season data
- Cold storage for historical archives

**Technologies:**
- **PostgreSQL** for structured player statistics and game metadata
- **Amazon S3** for video storage with intelligent tiering
- **Redis** for real-time stat caching and session management
- **Apache Parquet** files on S3 for analytical workloads
- **AWS DynamoDB** for player tracking coordinates (time-series data)

### 4. Analytics & Intelligence Layer

**Real-time Analytics:**
- Live performance metrics calculation
- Shooting percentages by court zone
- Player movement patterns and heat maps
- Fatigue detection through movement analysis

**Technologies:**
- **Apache Spark Streaming** for real-time analytics
- **Apache Flink** for complex event processing
- **Python** with NumPy/Pandas for statistical calculations
- **Databricks** for advanced analytics and ML pipelines

### 5. API & Application Layer

**Backend Services:**
- RESTful APIs for data access
- GraphQL for flexible data queries
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates

**Technologies:**
- **Django REST Framework** for API development
- **GraphQL with Apollo Server** for flexible queries
- **WebSocket** via Django Channels for real-time communication
- **Nginx** as reverse proxy and load balancer
- **Docker/Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration

### 6. Visualization & User Interface

**Frontend Applications:**
- Web dashboard for coaches and analysts
- Mobile app for on-court access
- Large display systems for team review sessions

**Technologies:**
- **Angular/React** for web application
- **D3.js** for interactive court visualizations
- **Chart.js** for statistical charts
- **React Native** for mobile applications
- **WebGL** for 3D court reconstructions

## Data Points Collected

### Player Movement Metrics
- **Position tracking**: X,Y coordinates sampled at 25 Hz
- **Speed and acceleration**: Calculated from position changes
- **Distance covered**: Total, sprinting, jogging, walking
- **Court zone occupancy**: Time spent in paint, perimeter, corners
- **Player spacing**: Distance between teammates/opponents

### Basketball-Specific Actions
- **Shot attempts**: Location, shot type, release angle, release time, defender distance
- **Passes**: Origin, destination, velocity, completion rate, assist potential
- **Turnovers**: Location, type (bad pass, travel, out of bounds), defensive pressure
- **Screens**: Screen quality, roll timing, defender navigation
- **Defensive actions**: Contests, steals, deflections, help rotations

### Biomechanical Data
- **Jump metrics**: Vertical leap height, landing force, takeoff angle
- **Shooting form**: Elbow angle, follow-through consistency, base alignment
- **Fatigue indicators**: Decreased speed, altered shooting form, reduced jump height

### Team Dynamics
- **Offensive spacing**: Average player separation, paint congestion
- **Ball movement**: Passes per possession, time of possession per player
- **Defensive rotations**: Help timing, closeout speed, communication frequency
- **Play execution**: Success rate by play type, execution speed

## Data Collection Methods

1. **Automated Computer Vision Pipeline**:
   - Continuous video processing extracts player positions and ball location
   - Pose estimation identifies specific basketball actions
   - Event detection triggers data logging (shots, passes, turnovers)

2. **Wearable Sensors** (Optional Enhancement):
   - GPS/accelerometer vests for precise movement tracking
   - Heart rate monitors for exertion levels
   - Pressure insoles for jump and landing forces

3. **Manual Annotation Interface**:
   - Coaching staff can tag specific plays or corrections
   - Quality assurance for automated detection
   - Subjective metrics (effort level, communication quality)

## System Benefits

1. **Objective Performance Measurement**: Removes subjective bias from player evaluation
2. **Injury Prevention**: Identifies fatigue patterns and biomechanical issues
3. **Tactical Insights**: Reveals team tendencies and optimal lineups
4. **Player Development**: Tracks improvement over time with granular metrics
5. **Scouting Preparation**: Simulates opponent strategies in practice

## Scalability & Performance

- **Horizontal scaling** through microservices architecture
- **Edge computing** reduces bandwidth requirements
- **Caching layers** for frequently accessed data
- **CDN** for video content delivery
- **Auto-scaling** based on processing load

## Security & Privacy

- **Encryption**: TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest
- **Access control**: Role-based permissions (coaches, players, analysts)
- **Data anonymization**: For aggregated team statistics
- **GDPR compliance**: For international players' data
- **Audit logging**: Track all data access and modifications

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI-powered coaching suggestions**: Real-time tactical adjustments
2. **VR integration**: Immersive film study sessions
3. **Predictive analytics**: Injury risk assessment, performance forecasting
4. **Natural language interface**: "Show me all pick-and-rolls where Player X was the screener"
5. **Integration with game footage**: Compare practice vs. game performance
